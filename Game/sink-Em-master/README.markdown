#  A GAME I BUILT WITH IMPACTJS

## [PLAY GAME](https://leanseverino1022.github.io/sink-Em/)

I found a guy online who was looking for someone to prototype a game in 2 weeks using ImpactJS(a JavaScript Game Engine) and his 2D game assets. I was told that if I do good I could be offered a job. I wasn't familiar at that time with Javascript and ImpactJS, but I had planned to learn JS for my career, so it made sense just to take the challenge. I was learning on the fly while creating the game and I hoped to get a job offer but I didn't get one. Anyway, I had fun creating the game while learning.
